# M-BLACK (Restricted Repository)

This repository contains material derived from the Pathological Envy framework that has been taken to its logical limit. The content is **descriptive, not prescriptive**, and is not intended to offer guidance, reassurance, or therapeutic application.

## Audience

This repository is intended **only** for advanced readers who:
- are familiar with state-based or regulatory models of psychology and social systems
- are not seeking emotional support, validation, or relational advice
- are not currently in acute relational instability, collapse, or loss

If any belief about relationships is presently required for your emotional stability, **do not proceed**.

## Scope

The material herein:
- formalizes conditions under which symmetry tolerance, asymmetry, and regulation arise
- derives implications that are structurally permitted but socially dispreferred
- removes several common narratives about endurance, growth-through-suffering, and unilateral repair

It does **not** argue how people should live, love, or relate.

## Use Conditions

By accessing this repository, you agree that the material:
- will not be redistributed, cited, or adapted without explicit permission
- will not be used for therapeutic, coaching, advisory, or corrective purposes
- will not be used to justify cruelty, withdrawal, coercion, or superiority
- will not be used to retroactively pathologize others or yourself

Misuse contradicts the framework and voids access.

## Reading Order

1. `PREFACE.md` — containment, consent, and epistemic framing  
2. `papers/M-BLACK-01.*` — primary derivation  
3. `diagrams/` — supporting topology and state-transition models  

Do not skip the Preface.

## Irreversibility Notice

Readers report that the material is not easily integrated in parts. Engagement may permanently alter relational perception. There is no neutral consumption.

Proceed only if you accept that some relational beliefs may not survive intact.
