# Appendix A — Structural Convergences and Intellectual Context

This appendix consolidates structural correspondences between the pathological envy framework and related theoretical, clinical, and systems-level formulations.

The purpose of this appendix is comparative and clarificatory, not diagnostic or historical. It is intended to reduce category errors by situating the framework in relation to adjacent bodies of thought without collapsing distinctions.

Sections will be added as needed to address recurring points of convergence, divergence, or misinterpretation.
